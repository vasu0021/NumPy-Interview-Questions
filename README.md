# Pandas Practice – 60+ Important Questions

This repository contains a comprehensive Pandas practice notebook where I have solved
60+ important, interview-oriented Pandas questions using a real-world sales dataset.

The notebook focuses on data analysis, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
using Pandas.
